# evolutionary-computation-project-2

This repository contains my second assignment for AIML 426, an evolutionary computation course at VUW.

Particle swarm optimisation, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms, cooperative co-evolution genetic programming, and reinforcement learning problems and algorithms were the focus of this project.
